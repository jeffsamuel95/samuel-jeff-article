        <p> Olympic National Park is a large park located in the Pacfic Northwestern state of Washington. Olympic national park contains 3 specific climate zones, the Temperate Rainforest, the snowy Cascade Mountain Range and the Rugged Pafific Coastline which is definitely not suitable for swimming. Mount Rainier, an activate volcano topping at 14,000 feet is only a 2 and a half hour drive from the park. The peaks within the park soar above 5,000 feet and the Hoh Rainfoest receives 150 inches of rain per year. The park is widely regarded as North America's best national park and that is mainly because of the diverse geographic features of the park.
